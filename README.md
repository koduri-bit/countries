![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


Thank You for checking out my project. I have done this frontend coding challenge to improve my skills in - HTML CSS Javascript and React ecosystem.

This challenge is taken from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) a  website
to find front-end todo coding projects. Anyone with frontend skills can pull, design, develop and submit code. You can check more about this website by clicking this link - [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/).

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

The requirement of this application is -

- User can open and view application both Mobile (375px wide) and Desktop (1445px wide)

- User can see all countries and few details for each country on its main page

- User can Filter countries based on region

- User can search a country from search box

- User can click border country link after reaching a single country

- User can switch theme `Dark Mode` or `Light Mode` by clicking moon icon on top right corner

- To pull countries and its details we should leverage [Get information about countries via a RESTful API](https://restcountries.eu/)


## To access this responsive application -

**Please click this link [Rest-Countries](https://koduri-bit.github.io/countries/)**

## Project Highlights - 

**I did this challenge using HTML, CSS, Javascript and React hooks (ex: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer etc).** 

**Application wide state is managed using `React Context`. And local state for component is managed using useState concept**

**This project comes under `Advanced` project in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)**

**I have leveraged CSS modules concept, so I can have separate class names for styling html.**

**I have used normal CSS with Flexbox and Grid concept for styling.**

**I have used `styled components` too.**

**I have used media queries for responsive design.**

**Desktop width targeted at 1440 and Mobile width targeted at 375.**

**No class based js files written for any react components. For class based type I will be doing another project and update in here with the link**
